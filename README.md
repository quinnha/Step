Step aims to ease student check-ins, and to ensure the safety of students during field trips/events. 
Teachers can set a geolocation to check in, where students will have to be in that area to check-in with the teacher. 
The teacher can then see who has checked in, and can see who hasn't checked in, easing the process. 
In addition, the Teacher can set a region in which they will be notified if a student leaves, so they can take appropriate action.

This is a front-end prototype imagined in Figma, and developed in HTML and CSS.
